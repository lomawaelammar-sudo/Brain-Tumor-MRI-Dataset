# Brain-Tumor-MRI-Dataset
This project uses ResNet50 with Transfer Learning to classify brain MRI scans into four categories-Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Tumor, and Normal Brain. Data augmentation improves model generalization, and early stopping prevents overfitting. The system achieves ~92% accuracy, showing potential as a reliable decision support tool for radiologists.
